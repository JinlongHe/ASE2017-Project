Download the [archive](https://golang.org/dl) and extract it into /usr/local, creating a Go tree in /usr/local/go. For example:

Add /usr/local/go/bin to the PATH environment variable. You can do this by adding this line to your /etc/profile (for a system-wide installation) or $HOME/.profile:
```
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
```
